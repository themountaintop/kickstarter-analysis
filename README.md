# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Analysis of Kickstarter data to uncover trends in funding of play projects.
---
The average set goal for play funding is around $4000, but more than half of them are for $2000 or less.

Recommendations: Set Goal funding for less than $4000. Setting the Goal for closer to $2000 will have a better chance at success given the data.
