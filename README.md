# Analysis of Play Focused Kickstarter Campaigns 

## An Analysis of Campaigns in Relation to Launch Dates and Funding Goals

### The purpose of this is to analyze different success and failure rates of funding campaigns for plays in the set time frame.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Campaigns from March to May see the highest successful rates, with rates dropping from June through, until resting at their lowest rate in December. This indiciates that the best times to start campaign funding may be in March, April, and May. June through September see lower rates of success each month. Failure rates follow a similar trend line, although the percentages are smaller. This could indicate the campaign had a high or higher than average funding goal.
